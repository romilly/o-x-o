 Reinforcement Learning From The Ground Up: "find out do that"
Reinforcement Learning: "We can use APL’s direct definition to" ― I'd say direct function if you want a full term (not dfn) as Iverson's direct definition is a distinct precursor to dfns.
"IN the lines below" → "In the lines below"
Seems odd that only the second time you define a dfn you explain the syntax.
Have you considered adopting a naming convention?
"but sometimes they are arrays.[1] As you have seen…" ― no, I haven't!
"whihc"
The note about ambivalence is repeated.
"samefunction" → "same function"
apl.wiki/Identity is much more interesting than the Dyalog documentation link.
