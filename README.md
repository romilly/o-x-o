# MENACE Revisited

This project is an implementation of Donald Michie's
[MENACE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchbox_Educable_Noughts_and_Crosses_Engine)
in [Dyalog APL](https://www.dyalog.com/).

The implementation builds an APL [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)
(Domain-specific language) for Noughts and Crosses (Tic-tac-toe).

This repository contains the source for a series of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) im APL.

[The book](https://romilly.github.io/o-x-o/chapter-1.html) is built from those notebooks
 using [jupyter{book}](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).

You can execute the notebooks and explore the code if you have jupyter,
Dyalog APL and the dyalog-jupyter kernel installed. Dyalog APL is free for non-commercial work.

You can read how to set up the required environment
[here](https://romilly.github.io/o-x-o/appendix-a.html).
