# MENACE Revisited

This project is an implementation of Donald Michie's MENACE in APL.

It contains the source for a [jupyter{book}](https://romilly.github.io/o-x-o/chapter-1.html)

The book is build from the notebooks from the repository.

You can execute the notebooks and explore the code if you have jupyter, Dyalog APL and the dyalog-jupyter kernel installed.

There's more informatiom abut how to set up the required environment [here](https://romilly.github.io/o-x-o/appendix-a.html).
