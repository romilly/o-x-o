# Project journal for o-x-o

## Thursday 10 December 2020

I am migrating the old private MENACE notebooks to this public repository and preparing to publish them as a
[jupyter{book}](https://romilly.github.io/o-x-o/an-introduction.html).

## Saturday 12 December 2020

The book is under way - incomplete but readable.

Today I will
1. ~~Tidy up the Appendix and README~~
1. Finish the chapter on canonical board representations.
1. Start the next chapter.

## Thursday 17 December 2020

I've been lax in maintaining the journal, but I have done a lot of work each day.

Today I need to round out, improve and finish Chapter 6.
I think Ch 7 will get us to the point where MENACE can play against a random or human opponent.

The plan is for Ch 8 to cover a version that maintains history across sessions in an APL file,
and Ch 9 to plot performance.

Note for tomorrow: the RI video demo of MENACE is at 37:30 in

## Friday 18 December 2020

I updated the README, and added a link from the introduction to Appendix A.
