    "## Types Of Player\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal is to create a framework that makes it easy to run MENACE with a variety of different player types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually we'll implement several types of players as APL functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also write a `game_runner` operator which will run a game with any combination of player type.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A `random_player` will pick a legal move at random.\n",
    "1. A `menace_player` will learn by using MENACE's strategy to chose which move to make.\n",
    "1. A `human_player` will enable a human to play the game.\n",
    "1. A `perfect_player` will make the best possible moves throughout the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will implement the `random_player`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't yet know a way to capture user input from a program running in an APL jupyter notebook, but it's easy to do when running a program using Dyalog's [RIDE](https://www.dyalog.com/dyalog/development-environment.htm) interface. Appendix B (currently under construction) will describe how to run a version of MENACE that also supports a `human_player`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these players will be implemented as an APL function which will take the current MENACE configuration as an argument, make a move and return an updated configuration as its result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Game Runner Code\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll plug the players into a `game_runnner` which we will implement as a *defined* operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in APL, a *function* returns data but an *operator* returns a function. Our `game_runner` will take a pair of player functions as arguments and return a function that will play an entire game.\n",
    "\n",
    "That function will take an argument that captures the MENACE configuration and return an updated configuration as its result.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's possible to use a nested array to hold the configuraton data but that would requre the code to know positional information. In software we can dientify data by position or by name. In this case, using meaningful names will help readability. In APL we can use a new type of data structure called a *namespace'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Namespaces in Dyalog APL\n",
    "\n",
    "One use of namespaces is to represent hierarchical data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create a two-level structure to represent a configuration. The top level will contain data like anticipated postions and their bead counts. It will contain a nested structure that has information about the game in progress."

    "## The MENACE configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The MENACE configuration will contain the information needed by the players and the `game_runner`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout a game *all* player types need to know the configuration for the current board. If we track the moves actually made during a game, the current board is simply the last of the moves in the current game, so the game history contains it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually we may want to examine MENACE's performance over time. For that reason the configuration will maintain a history of wins, draws and losses. The `game_runner` will eventually need to maintain that information but the player functions will ignore it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original version of MENACE chose its moves and tracked their value by using beads in a matchbox. If a matchbox was used during a game its contents were adjusted when the game was over.\n",
    "\n",
    "A player that applies MENACE's strategy needs to access and update that information so we will eventually need to include it in the MENACE configuration. It's not needed by a `random_player` so we will omit it for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, then, we will start with a MENACE Namespace that contains two sorts of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A history of the current `game`, held as a matrix of position vectors, one row per move.\n",
    "1. A vector of MENACE's game `results`. A win is represented by 1, a draw by 0 and a loss by ¯1.\n",
