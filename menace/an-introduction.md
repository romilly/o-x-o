# MENACE in APL

This is a short book that implements Donald Michie's MENACE in software using the APL language.

It's a *work in progress*, but it is currently about 70% complete.

It's not an APL tutorial.

I hope that the book has enough explanation and examples for you to be able to follow the flow.

If you would like to learn more abut APL or want to experiment with the code in the notebooks the next chapter explains how you can do that.
