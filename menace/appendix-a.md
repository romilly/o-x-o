# Appendix A - Exploring Dyalog APL

I suggest that you follow [this advice](https://rojergs.github.io/MDAPL/README.html)
which was written for Dyalog's free on-line version of **Mastering Dyalog APL**.

The notebooks in this book are in [this MENACE repository](https://github.com/romilly/o-x-o).

There are also some great free resources listed on Dyalog's [TryAPL](https://tryapl.org/) website.
