    "1. a `random_player` player function which will pick a legal move at random, and\n",

    "1. a `human_player` in which a real person plays one side of the game.\n",
    "1. a `perfect_player` who makes the best possible moves throughout the game.\n",

Appendix B (currently under construction) will describe how to run a version of MENACE that also supports a `human_player`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Throughout a game *all* player types need to know the configuration for the current board. If we track the moves actually made during a game, the current board is simply the last of the moves in the current game, so the game history contains it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually we may want to examine MENACE's performance over time. For that reason the configuration will maintain a history of wins, draws and losses. The `game_runner` will maintain that information but the player functions will ignore it.\n",
