    "\n",
    "The original MATCHBOX-based MENACE remembered the lessons from past games using matchboxes and beads.\n",
    "1. It used one matchbox for each board position that MENACE might enounter.\n",
    "1. Each machbox was labelled. The label showed the position represented by the box, and showed each possible move from that position. Possible moves were shown in different colours.\n",
    "1. Each matchbox contained beads of colours that matched those on the label. The beads determined the probability that MENACE would make the corresponding move.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our implementation we will maintain the bead information as a two element vector, with each element an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first element will be a vector of decoded (numerical) positions.\n",
    "The second element will be a matrix of bead counts, with one row per possible position and 9 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each column will corespond to one of the possible moves from the position, and will contain the number of virtual beads corresponding to that move. Some moves will not be possible because the sqare is already occupied. We will initialse the bead counts for such positions to zero, and the counts will never get updated, since the correponding moves will never be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: Add illustration of a position (in vector and display form) and its bead counts\n",
    "\n",
    "The values for possible moves will be initialised to some fixed number when a new MENACE configuration is created, and will then get adjusted at the end of each game by MENACE's learning rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bead data will form a new third element of the MENACE configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MENACE's Learning Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of a game MENACE adjusted the bead counts.\n",
    "1. If MENACE *won* it added three beads of the same colour matching those picked during the game.\n",
    "1. If MENACE *drew* it added one bead of the appropriate colour to each matchbox used.\n",
    "1. If MENACE *lost* it removed three beads of the appropriate colour from each matchbox used.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll extend `game_runner` to do the same to our virtual bead counts."

    "\n",
    "In his original design for MENACE, Donald Michie eliminated redundant board positions from consideration and specified that MENACE always made the first move.\n",
    "\n",
    "He did this in order to reduce the number of machboxes required to a manageable number. A secondary benefit was that one game could provide reinforement for a whole family of symetric versions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are representing the matchboxed by values in an array we are not constrained in the same way, and the time taken to train the system is also less of a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also allow a `menace_player` to be the first or second player.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would need more code to match a real game position to its canonical representation, so we won't do so in this chapter. We could maintain a virtual matchbox for beads for every  possible position, but many of those could never occur in play. We can reduce the 19683 positions considerably by using the `ok` function which checks the number of `×`s and `○`s.\n",
